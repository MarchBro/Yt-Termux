### A light weight tool to download any kind of Video, Music or shorts from Youtube with 2 clicks on your phone using Termux.
<hr>

Termux-YTD2.0 is a Upgraded version of Termux-YTD, Since Youtube-dl really slow know Termux-YTD is still downloading things but really slow and Termux-YTD2.0 overcomes that problem. I have added all the previous features of Termux-YTD as well as added youtube shorts support. So now while watching shorts you can just share any shorts with termux and it will download it at a lightning speed.
